## 22-May-2023 Git & Github

1. Difference between GUI & CLI
 I have Known that CLI mainly used by **developers**, and GUI used by **normal users**.
2. Basic terminal commands using Ubuntu.

- Ubuntu connects the operating systems *Windows* and *Linux* together, used for different commands.
- Also we discuss the difference between *directory*, *folder*, and *files*.

3. Learning about Git & Github

- How we link the local with github using git commands **(ACP)**.
- Generated ***SSH keys*** and connected them to github profile.
- clone the created Repo on github "my-notes" and opened it in VS code, also modified the readme file then pushed it into the github.

At the end Miss Rawan showed us how to use Discord platform and create tickets, accept and solve if we have ny problem.
